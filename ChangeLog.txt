2.0.0.2
	-Update for KSP 1.3.

2.0.0.1
	-Oops, found a problem with switching kerbals 5 minutes after releasing. Fixed this.

2.0.0.0
	-A ton of work on making walking, running and swimming more smooth.
	-Reset kerbal's view using the 'v' key when in FP mode.
	-Free rotation and translation added to floating EVA mode. Controls match those used for a vessel. Defaults: ad=yaw, qe=roll, ws=pitch, jl=translate left/right, ik=translate up/down, hn=translate forward/back. A stabilization-mode sas is available.
	-"Fine controls" for RCS packs is by throttle controls while in FP mode. The more throttle, the more pack power. More or less fuel is used as appropriate.
	-Some fixes to stock glitchy behavior for walking kerbals in low-g; prevent getting stuck trying to land on a steep slope, allow the player to break out of a running bound (especially useful for Gilly and Pol). These fixes apply both in first and third person mode.
	-Display the name of the kerbal when switching inside IVA.
	-Navball now functions normally in FP mode, referenced to the kerbal.
